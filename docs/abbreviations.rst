Abbreviations and Acronyms
==========================

Because I'm too lazy to write out the full thing. 

Well-known abbreviations, like NATO, can be used at first instance. Otherwise, write out the full name with bracketed abbreviation on first instance. For example: "The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) said something. NARA officials also said something."

All two-letter abbreviations should not use any periods. The exception is "U.S." for United States. So United Nations would be "UN", United Kingdom "UK", European Union "EU", etc. 

All abbreviations three letters or more should not use any periods, like UNICEF or ICBM.
