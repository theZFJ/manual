Writing News Articles
=====================

Before trying to write news articles, I recommend you go and read a ton of reports from a wire agency like `Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/>`_ or `AP <https://apnews.com/>`_. Wire agencies are the professionals who write up a report immediately and disseminate it to many newspapers for publication. 

Newsworthiness
--------------

Perhaps you've heard of "MAN BITES DOG" before? What makes it different from "DOG BITES MAN?" 

The first headline is more interesting because it's unexpected. 

When you want to write a report, you should consider whether or not the story is interesting enough to be published.

Consider: 
* **Relevance** - does the story affect the readers? 
* **Timeliness** - how quickly did you get the story out? has it been too long since it happened? 
    * Getting articles out on time is critical!!! There's only so long before it all becomes the olds instead of news!!!
    * Bonus points if you're the first to break the news.

Gathering Information
---------------------

Pick reliable sources and cross-reference all facts. It's our job to check that everything we publish is accurate. 

The manual's directory of sources has some good places to start. Contact an editor if you need help finding information. 

Interviews are essential. Think about the kinds of people affected by an event (stakeholders, if you will) and try to get their statements. If you need help thinking of or finding people, contact an editor.

Consider that article I wrote in January 2022 on the return to school after winter break during the largest COVID-19 surge of the pandemic. Some people important to interview include:
* Students 
* Parents 
* Teachers
* Principal/School Administrators
* Superintendent/Board of Education
* School Nurse
* Custodial Staff

Structuring the Article
-----------------------

The inverted pyramid writing style is popular among journalists. You start with the most important information at the top and the least important information at the bottom. 

The first sentence should be able to summarise the entire article. For example, for the aforementioned COVID-19 return to school article, I wrote::

    In a move inconsistent with school districts across New Jersey, Edison Township Public Schools has continued in-person instruction following winter break.

Reading a lot of professional wire agency reports will help you get a good feel for a first sentence. 

The next few sentences should include the most crucial information. 

Use the quotes that you diligently collected during interviews!!! They're good stuff. Give a general idea of what people are saying ("Some students say...," "Multiple residents expressed...," "Several attendees said..."), then provide quotes to support your assertion.

Don't include opinions. That's called editorialising, and it's prohibited. Use neutral language and avoid connotations that could introduce bias. Opinions stay in the Opinion Department. Last thing we need is a government officer ripping us apart for bias (feel free to enquire with EIC Wu about the COVID-19 return to school article incident). 

A news report is NOT like an essay in school. You don't need to end with something profound. News reports can be left open in case more information is added later.

Here's an article example Sushanth Balaraman and I wrote: https://ehseagleseye.com/5090/sports/goal-girls-lacrosse-scores-its-winningest-season-ever/
