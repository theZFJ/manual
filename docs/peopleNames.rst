Names of People
===============

NEVER ASSUME HOW TO SPELL SOMEONE'S NAME. An offence punishable by burning at the stake. 

Okay, well, I can't burn you at the stake, but you should get the point. 

Smith or Smyth? Chris or Kris? Jay or Jai? Caitlyn or Kaitlyn? Britney, Britteney, or Brittany? Sean or Shawn??? Lindsay or Lindsey??? Steven or Stephen?????????? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

You get the point. **NEVER ASSUME HOW TO SPELL SOMEONE'S NAME.**

Use the full name at the first instance, and the surname for any subsequent mentions. 

Some Asian countries list family name first and given name second. Double check!!! 

Person refused to give you a name? Say "declined to be identified".
