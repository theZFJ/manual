Editing Process
===============

When you start writing your article, make sure to create an issue in `the ZFJ Article Tracker <https://github.com/theZFJ/articleTracker>`_ to track your progress. 

Once you're ready, an editor will be asked to look over your article and leave Google Docs comments. If you disagree with any of the edits, please discuss it with the editor before resolving the comments.

Escalate any issues to the next editor in the chain.
