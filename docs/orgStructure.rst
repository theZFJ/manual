Organisation Structure
======================

The editor-in-chief and copyeditors oversee all departments. An associate editor oversees a specific department. 

Rorschach does like fancy names because he's read too many Wikipedia articles on government agencies, so here you go. It's really more for organising news. Or if you want a cool thing for a college resume.

Not news. Requires special colouration to denote that fact. 

* Opinion Department - For anything expressly meant for expressing opinions of the writers. Label: Opinion. Colour: Purple 
* Office of Strategic Satire - Because we all love *The Onion*. Name is definitely not a parody of the WWII U.S. intelligence agency "Office of Strategic Services" that eventually led to the CIA. Label: Satire. Colour: Dark Green 
    * Note: Explicitly saying it's satire may be very unfortunate to have to do, but if we're gonna mix it in with the regular news, we're gonna have to label it.
