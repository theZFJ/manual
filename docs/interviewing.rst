Interviewing
============

What, I actually have to talk to other people??? 

Preparation
-----------

Research the topic so that you know the basics. You won't have to ask really basic questions and will establish credibility with the interviewee.

Prepare some questions on stuff you want to hit when questioning. Don't limit your questions to what you've prepared!!! You can always ask more questions you think of during the interview and follow up on answers.

Make sure you know the interviewee's name and their titles or positions. 

Conducting the Interview
------------------------

Chat about general stuff before you start asking questions. It helps the interviewee relax. Be chill. 

Ask the interviewee for the consent to record the interview before you start the tape. Recording is definitely preferred because you won't have to frantically scribble notes. Keep your recorder and/or notebook to the side so that the interviewee isn't constantly visually reminded that they're being recorded.

Start with open questions and let the interviewee talk. If the interviewee needs time to think, give them time to think. You can then use closed questions to follow up on specific points.

With difficult questions, start with something like "Some people have said..." to indicate that you don't necessarily share the opinion. 

Do not ask multiple questions at a time. The interviewee will only answer the easiest one. 

If you don't understand the interviewee, that's okay. Ask a question like "If I understand you correctly...."

To conclude, ask a question like "Is there anything else you'd like to add?" in case there's any additional information the interviewee would like you to know.
